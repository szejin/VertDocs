# Getting Started with Mining

Hello there! Welcome to the VertDocs guide to Getting Started with Mining Vertcoin (VTC). In cryptocurrency, mining means to provide computation power to solve certain mathematical equations which in return helps keep the entire network (also known as the blockchain) secure. Miners are incentivized by the block rewards provided when a block is found for the network.

Let's get started!

## Basic Requirements for mining VTC

To begin mining Vertcoin, you should be able to fulfill the following:

1. **Decent Equipment** - A computer with (*recommended*) Nvidia 10 / AMD XX series cards or (*minimum*) Nvidia 9 / AMD XX series cards. 
2. **Understand your electricity tariff** - Assuming an electricity tariff of $0.1/kWh, if you have *Decent Equipment* as stated above, you'll most likely mine with a decent profit. However, if your electricity tariff rate is low you may be able to mine profitably even with an older card.
3. **Stable internet connection** - Doesn't need to be blazing fast, just normal cable/fibre will do but it has to be stable for optimum results.
4. **Patience** - Setting up your mining tools etc. can be really quick, or it can be really troublesome for some people. As long as you have the heart to follow through, no reason you can't be mining with decent equipment! :)
5. **More patience** - Ideally, set things up and let it run for 24 hours or more before you decide if its worth it at all. This is especially true if you are mining on p2pools (LINK TO GUIDE). Regular pools will pay you almost every hour, but that does not mean that it is better. You can try around to see what works best for you.
6. **Finish this guide series!** - No really. Try and finish this guide. I promise it'll be worth it! 

That said, lets get going!
